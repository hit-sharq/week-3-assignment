#Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
#Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):

    if discount_percent >= 20:
        # Calculate the discount amount
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        # Calculate the final price after discount
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        # Return the original price if discount is less than 20%
        return price

# Prompt user for original price and discount percentage
original_price = float(input("Enter the original price of the item: "))
discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Calculate the final price
final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)

# Print the results
if final_price < original_price:
    print(f"The final price after applying the discount is: ${final_price:.2f}")
else:
    print(f"No discount applied. The price remains: ${final_price:.2f}")
